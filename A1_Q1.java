// Algorithm 1: Solar Roof Energy Calculator
//
//This algorithm is a tool that can be used to calculate solar roof Energy. The user is required to provide information about the number of solar panels, the wattage rating of each solar panel (in watts), the average number of sunlight hours per day, and the efficiency of the solar panels. With that information, the program is able to calculate the daily and annual energy production of the solar roof.
